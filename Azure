Regions : set of datacenters
Regions Pair : each region is connected to a region. 
 - Fatsest connection. Useful for backups.

 - If the Pair is to another country, then data may leave that country.( Bazil with US has one way pair).
 - If pair is within same country, data wont leave that country( eg: Canada)
 - Qatar is the first country with no pair. Do not support Geo Redundant Storage(GRS). U need to take care of backups.Use AZ for availability
