AZ 500

MarketPlace : Offered by other companies( open source or paid)

IaaS : Client is responisble for OS updates. CP is responisble for Physical Security.
PaaS : CP takes care of OS updates. You are responsible for network.
Saas: Eg: Sql Database

Azure Local : Lets u run azure functionality on your hardware. Azure Ark - Same control Plane for Private and Public.

Availability
Scalability
Elasticity(Auto scaling). System monitors some metric add/remove servers.
Reliability : Recover from failues. Come back quickly. Avoid single points of failure. Multi region deployment. Backups. Monitoring.
Preditability
Security.
  - Microsoft Security Response Center
  - Always on Ddos
  - Azure Policy
  - RBAC
  - Encryption by default
Redundancy
Goverance ( Company Policies)
  - Policies are followed
  - Auditing and Reporting
  - HIPAA , PCC and GDPR
  - Management Subscriptions ( Similar to AWS OUs)

IaaS : Azure Virtual Machines, Azure Storage, Virtual Networks
PaaS : Azure App Service, Azure SQL Storage, FrontDoor, LoadBalancer, Firewalls
SaaS : Office 365. DropBox, One Drive, Skype . Just use the applications.

Azure Function(Equvalent to AWS Lambdas) : fisrt one million per month is free
- Cost Efficient for intermittent workloads(dev test).
- Cannot predict cost. it is based on use
- Cold Start


Azure Provisioning - ARM templates, Biceps, Terraform, CLI, Powershell


Core Azure Architecture
----------------------

Regions : set of datacenters connect by low-latency network.
Regions Pair : each region is connected to a region. 
 - Fatsest connection. Useful for backups.
 - Updates wont happen concurrently for a region pair.
 - If the Pair is to another country, then data may leave that country.( Bazil with US has one way pair).
 - If pair is within same country, data wont leave that country( eg: Canada)
 - Qatar is the first country with no pair. Do not support Geo Redundant Storage(GRS). U need to take care of backups.Use AZ for availability
 - 60+ regions. There are rescrictions like for some countries you should be a resident.
Sovereign Regions
  - Use by Country or Government
  - They are not connected to Azure Public Cloud
  - Require approal to join a subscription
  - Different complance and security
  - in US Azure Government, Azure Government Secret, Azure Government Top Secret
  - China - Org with business in China
Availability Zones : Physically seperated data centers within each Region. ( seperate buildings in a location 
or few miles apart locations). High speed network connection between Azs. Each zone has dedicated physical infra.
Few regions dont have AZs.
Not every support AZs.


3 Types of AZ Serices
Zonal Service : Resource deployed to a specific AZ. Eg. Virtual Machines.
Zone Redundant Service: Automatically deployed to multile Az Eg: Azure SQL Database.
Always Available Service : Globally services. Active Directory, Azure FrontDoor.

LB, Gateway - Flexible. Zonal or Zone redundant.

Resources and Resource Group
Management Groups -> Subscriptions-> Resource Groups -> Resources

A resource is associated with one and only one subscription. Resource cost is billed to that subscription.

Resource Group
- Is a logical group of resources. Same lifecycle ( created /managed and destroyed and  deployed together).
- A resource group is associated with a region, but it can contain resources within different regions.

A resource is associated with one and only one Resource Group.
Permissions can be assigned at Resource Group level.
There is no security boundary offered by resource group. Unless otherwise restrcted a resource group can access another resource group.

Subscriptions

- A billing Unit
- Administrative Boundary - Compliance
- Users can have access to different Subscription
- Enterprise Agreement
- A subsciption is associated to one and only one Management Group.

Management Groups
- Management Groups can be nested. 
- Management Groups can own other management Groups. 
- Pre defined resources available to all resources.
- Forms a Hierarchy. Root Management group.
- A Management Group can have multiple subscriptions.
- Management Group is Optional
- A management group can have a maz of 6 layers ( Important)
- Allows apply of Azure and RBAC policy, governance policy at top level - Inheritance. Inherited by all subscriptions underneath.

How to use CP Shared Responsibility in Controls?
Does traffic flactuate for all applications?

Load testing
Disaster Recovery Testing

How are we making sure where data resides ( regions?)
